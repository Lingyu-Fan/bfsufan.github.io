    <p>The "Options" item provides you with more personalized settings, as shown in the picture below.</p>
    <p><img src='images/10 Options.png' alt='' /></p>
    <p>For example, if you are a gamer and want less impact while playing games, you can try Options -> Very Fast transitions (in f.lux v4).
If you are a slugabed on the weekend, then "Sleep in on weekends" is a better choice.
The function "backwards alarm clock" will remind you to go to bed if you’re still using your computer when you should be catching z’s. The app sends an alert every half-hour in the nine hours leading to your wake-up time. For example, if you’re on your computer at 10 p.m. and you’re supposed to rise at 7 a.m., f.lux will tell you you’re cutting into valuable sleep time.</p>
