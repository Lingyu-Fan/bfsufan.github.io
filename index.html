  <h1>F.lux your lights</h1>
  <p>Commercial Translation, Diplomatic Interpreting, Introduction to Interpreting studies, Introduction to Localization, News Transediting ... OMG! So many deadlines!
Every night, when everything quiets down, my show has just begun.
It is at this time that I realize I have so many health issues: backache, neck pain, lumbago and most irritatingly, sore eyes.
No eyedrops seem to work. The problem has to be tackled at the source.</p>

  <p>The spectrum of colors from our computer screens are varied, and so are these colours’ wavelengths.
Certain colors on the spectrum, like blue light, are harder on the eyes because they have shorter wavelengths and are high energy.
Blue light also flickers more frequently on computer screens’ LED backlight controllers, and this flickering causes more eye fatigue than other colours like red or orange.</p>
  <p><span>f.lux</span> is a cross-platform computer program that adjusts a display's color temperature according to location and time of day, offering functional respite for the eyes.
The program is designed to reduce eye strain during night-time use, helping to reduce disruption of sleep patterns. Click the left navigation bars to start the magical f.lux journey.</p>
